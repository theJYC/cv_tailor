# cv_tailor

Ever been frustrated by having to tailor your CV to match the job descriptions of the 1000s of positions you're applying for?

Would you benefit from a software that collects your CV, and returns a more targeted rewrite that boosts your chances in the competitive job market? 

This is a python application that is meant to tailor your cv to the job they are applying for. The cvtailor will first ask for general information such as the name and contact details. Then the user will input a preferred profession from some options. The user will then enter relevant sections of the cv together with the relevant skills gained. For example the user can list their experience and select the appropriate skill gained such as teamwork. 

The cvtailor application takes in this information and with the knowledge of the profession they are applying for assesses whether the information entered by the user is relevant depending on whether the skills associated with the entry is relevant to the profession.

The cv tailor application returns the cv with the sections that highlight the relevant skills for the profession for which the user is applying.

Background:

This application automates this process by selecting the relevant sections from the cv entered, mahing the skills the job requires to those sections entered that meet this requirement.
